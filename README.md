## Technical Review: How To Update (for Author Team)
This is a R Markdown website, published at [https://geodacenter.github.io/opioid-environment-toolkit/](https://geodacenter.github.io/opioid-environment-toolkit/). To add tutorials, open the .Rproj file in RStudio, add Rmd files to the repository, and click the "Build Website" button under the "Build" tab. HTML files will be generated in the `docs` folder, which will build as a website on Github when pushed up.
