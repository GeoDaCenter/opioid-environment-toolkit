This is a R Markdown website. To add tutorials, open the .Rproj file in RStudio, add Rmd files to the repository, and click the "Build Website" button under the "Build" tab. HTML files will be generated in the `docs` folder, which will build as a website on Github when pushed up.

To learn more about R Markdown websites, take a look at the [R Markdown documentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html).
